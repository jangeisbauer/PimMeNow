You configure your PIM profiles with:

* Profile Name
* User Account

* PIM Role
* Duration
* Microsoft Edge Profile Number

PimMeNow will then start a GUI and give you the choice to connect to one of your PIM profiles. Justification Reasons will be saved to a txt file and offered to you via autocomplete in your next session. After you have authenticated against the appropriate AAD, the related Edge profile for that PIM profile will start.
